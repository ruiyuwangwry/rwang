## Bio

I am now a PhD student in Temple University. My supervisor is Dr. Eric Borguet and Dr. Vincenzo Carnevale. <br>
I am doing various types of research projects; I am focusing on water structures in several enviroments, such as chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, ion adsorption at water/alumina interfaces using both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, especially free energy calculations using enhanced sampling techniques. Our team are current investigating pKa calculations, surface-solute interactions and proton/hydroxide ion behavior.  <br>
Besides "science", I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, for example, how these tools and proper physics models help business analysis.
