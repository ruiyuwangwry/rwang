## Bio

I am now a PhD student in Temple University. My supervisor is Dr. Eric Borguet and Dr. Vincenzo Carnevale. <br>
I am doing various types of research projects; I am focusing on water structures in several enviroments, such as chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, ion adsorption at water/alumina interfaces using both classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, especially free energy calculations using enhanced sampling techniques. Our team are current investigating pKa calculations, surface-solute interactions and proton/hydroxide ion behavior.  <br>
Besides "science", I am also interested in modern technologies such as machine learning and its applications, for example, how these tools and proper physics models help business analysis.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ruiyuwangwry/water_interface/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ruiyuwangwry/water_interface/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
